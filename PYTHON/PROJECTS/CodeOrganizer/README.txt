Code Organizer - Readme
By Apostasy(S Shravan Kumar)

Issues Planned to be Resolved
Organizing Multiple solutions to multiple problems in multiple languages in multiple websites for multiple contests.
1) Provide Versioning for each problem wherein each problem can be solved multiple times in the same language.
2) Provide a mechanism to organize solutions to the same problem in different languages.
3) Mark whether a problem is complete or not.
4) Open a compatible editor for the corresponding language.(It's gonna be vim from now on)
5) Uniquely identify each problem using a unique Id maybe and also provide a search capability for problems and their solutions based on that unique Id.
6) Devise a mechanism to retrieve the problem statement, the sample test cases.
7) Provide a mechanism to run a given code on a set of sample test cases and validate success.
8) Provide a mecahnism to add user's sample cases.
9) Provide a mechanism to measure the time taken to run the test cases and the memory occupied.
10) Provide a mechanism to backup all the data into a user specified location and also to retrieve this data from that location.

Hopefully, this will lead to learning all sorts of stuff in both python and the linux kernel and linux too.
