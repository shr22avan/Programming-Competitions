  o Minor code improvements:
    - Remove instances of strcpy from the unit tests. They weren't
      hurting anything, since they were only in the unit tests, but
      it's embarassing to have strcpy() in the code at all, and some
      analysis tools don't like it. Fixes 8790. Patch from Arlo Breault.
