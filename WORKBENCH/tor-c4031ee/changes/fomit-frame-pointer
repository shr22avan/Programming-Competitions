  o Minor features (performance):
    - If we're using the pure-C 32-bit curve25519_donna implementation
      of curve25519, build it with the -fomit-frame-pointer option to
      make it go faster on register-starved hosts. This improves our
      handshake performance by about 6% on i386 hosts without nacl.
      Closes ticket 8109.
